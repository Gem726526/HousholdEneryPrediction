# HousholdEneryPrediction
In this project, we explored several regression models to predict household energy consumption using a variety of household features. After preprocessing the data—handling missing values, removing outliers, engineering new features, and normalizing the dataset—we built and evaluated Vanilla Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net models.
The Lasso Regression model proved to be the best performer, achieving the highest predictive accuracy while also simplifying the model through feature selection. By eliminating irrelevant features, Lasso offered a more interpretable and practical solution for predicting energy consumption. The optimized Elastic Net model, which balanced Lasso and Ridge regularization, performed well but did not surpass Lasso in terms of MSE or R².
